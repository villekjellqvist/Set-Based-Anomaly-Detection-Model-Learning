	abstract = {In this study, the authors propose an adaptive model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for constrained linear systems in state space subject to uncertain model parameters and disturbances. An iterative set membership identification algorithm is first presented to update the uncertain parameter set at each time step. Based on the shrunken uncertain parameter set, an MPC controller is then designed to robustly stabilise the uncertain systems subject to state and input constraints. The algorithm can efficiently reduce the size of the uncertain parameter set in min–max MPC setting, and therefore improve the control performance. The algorithm is proved to ensure constraint satisfaction, recursive feasibility and input‐to‐state practical stability of the closed‐loop system even in the presence of system uncertainties. A numerical example and a brief comparison with traditional min–max MPC are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of secure data reconstruction for unknown systems, where data collected from the system are susceptible to malicious manipulation. We aim to recover the real trajectory without prior knowledge of the system model. To achieve this, a behavioral language is used to represent the system, describing it using input/output trajectories instead of state-space models. We consider two attack scenarios. In the first scenario, up to \$k\$ entries of the collected data are malicious. On the other hand, the second scenario assumes that at most \$k\$ channels from sensors or actuators can be compromised, implying that any data collected from these channels might be falsified. For both scenarios, we formulate the trajectory recovery problem as an optimization problem and introduce sufficient conditions to ensure successful recovery of the true data. Since finding exact solutions to these problems can be computationally inefficient, we further approximate them using an \${\textbackslash}ell\_1\$-norm and group Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). We demonstrate that under certain conditions, these approximation problems also find the true trajectory while maintaining low computation complexity. Finally, we extend the proposed algorithms to noisy data. By reconstructing the secure trajectory, this work serves as a safeguard mechanism for subsequent data-driven control methods.},

Then, a data-driven algorithm is proposed to identify the attack-free sensors when the plant is controlled online. We also provide necessary conditions, based on the properties of the plant, under which the algorithm is feasible. An extension of the algorithm is presented to identify the sensors completely online against certain classes of attacks. The efficacy of our algorithm is depicted through numerical examples.},

A grey-box, or semi-physical, nonlinear state-space representation is introduced, expressing the nonlinear basis functions using a limited number of measured output variables. This representation assumes that the observed nonlinearities are localised in physical space, which is a generic case in mechanics. A two-step identification procedure is derived for the grey-box model parameters, integrating nonlinear subspace initialisation and weighted least-squares optimisation. The complete procedure is applied to an electrical circuit mimicking the behaviour of a single-input, single-output (SISO) nonlinear mechanical system and to a single-input, multiple-output (SIMO) geometrically nonlinear beam structure.},

	abstract = {Recent successes in the field of machine learning, as well as the availability of increased sensing and computational capabilities in modern control systems, have led to a growing interest in learning and data-driven control techniques. Model predictive control (MPC), as the prime methodology for constrained control, offers a significant opportunity to exploit the abundance of data in a reliable manner, particularly while taking safety constraints into account. This review aims at summarizing and categorizing previous research on learning-based MPC, i.e., the integration or combination of MPC with learning methods, for which we consider three main categories. Most of the research addresses learning for automatic improvement of the prediction model from recorded data. There is, however, also an increasing interest in techniques to infer the parameterization of the MPC controller, i.e., the cost and constraints, that lead to the best closed-loop performance. Finally, we discuss concepts that leverage MPC to augment learning-based controllers with constraint satisfaction properties.},

Lennart Ljung's System Identification: Theory for the User is a complete, coherent description of the theory, methodology, and practice of System Identification. This completely revised Second Edition introduces subspace methods, methods that utilize frequency domain data, and general non-linear black box methods, including neural networks and neuro-fuzzy modeling. The book contains many new computer-based examples designed for Ljung's market-leading software, System Identification Toolbox for MATLAB. Ljung combines careful mathematics, a practical understanding of real-world applications, and extensive exercises. He introduces both black-box and tailor-made models of linear as well as non-linear systems, and he describes principles, properties, and algorithms for a variety of identification techniques: Nonparametric time-domain and frequency-domain methods. Parameter estimation methods in a general prediction error setting. Frequency domain data and frequency domain interpretations. Asymptotic analysis of parameter estimates. Linear regressions, iterative search methods, and other ways to compute estimates. Recursive (adaptive) estimation techniques. Ljung also presents detailed coverage of the key issues that can make or break system identification projects, such as defining objectives, designing experiments, controlling the bias distribution of transfer-function estimates, and carefully validating the resulting models. The first edition of System Identification has been the field's most widely cited reference for over a decade. This new edition will be the new text of choice for anyone concerned with system identification theory and practice},
